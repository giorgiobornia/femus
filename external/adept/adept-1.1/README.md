# Adept
## Fast automatic differentiation library in C++

The Adept software library provides the capability to automatically differentiate an algorithm written in C++.
It uses expression templates in a way that allows it to compute adjoints and Jacobian matrices significantly
faster than the leading current tools that use the same approach of operator overloading, and often not much
slower than hand-written adjoint code.
